### Meta
**Status**: Work in progress - **Done** - Obsolete
**Updated**: 14.02.2025

### Goal
During this part of the evaluation, we wanted to see if sending a request to an offer, receifying it and replying on the request would be a logical process for the normal user (in our case a sibling).

### Method
The said sibling was instructed to create an account, try to create an offer and send a request to an already existing offer. Afterwards he should react on a request of an other user on his offer and try to respond to it.

### Results
We have noticed, during our original approach of an Inbox-style conversation, where each user send a message which lands in the inbox of the other user vice versa, so they can reply and send a message to the inbox again, that its an unnecessarily complicated process, which felt very unnatural for the sibling and not visually pleasing aswell.

### Implications

We had to change the approach and go for an Chat-style conversation, where the user could select the active conversation on the left of the screen, which opens the according chat so all the messages can be seen from both users. For the teser the new way of communication felt much more natural and easier to navigate/ use.
