## The problem
In the vibrant world of anime, fans often struggle to find a community where they can connect with like-minded individuals, trade merchandise, and share their passion for their favorite series. Current platforms may lack the specialized features that cater to anime enthusiasts, leaving them feeling isolated in their love for the medium. Additionally, anime watchers often find it challenging to keep track of what they’ve watched, manage their watchlists, and share reviews with others.
